## Standing on the shoulder's of giants

I use a variety of libraries/frameworks most of these are listed in the following places:

* Python: [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Rawtechio/rawtechio.github.io/blob/master/requirements.txt)
* Node: [package.json](https://github.com/Rawtechio/rawtechio.github.io/blob/master/package.json)
* Frontend: [bower.json](https://github.com/Rawtechio/rawtechio.github.io/blob/master/bower.json)

I also use the lovely [iconic](https://useiconic.com/) icons. Please don't be a :poop: head and download their icons from my repo or website, buy a license and support the author.
